Fix facial animation, fivem 2944 gamebuild.

Hi this is my first post, sorry for any errors. I noticed that with the latest gamebuild 2944 there is a problem. Mouths are not synced correctly between players when speaking. In order to prevent anyone from profiting from it and while waiting for a fix from Fivem, I am releasing this free code developed by me which will fix the problem. I hope it can be useful to you.
